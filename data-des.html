                        <p>The pie chart to the right demonstrates the most visited social media websites in the United States as of 2023; it includes Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Youtube. It’s quite clear that Facebook holds a majority of visitors at 55%, which should be expected. Facebook is the oldest platform of these five sites as it was created in 2004. While Facebook was not the first social networking platform to be created, its advanced components, community features, and  user-friendliness quickly pushed it to the forefront of social media. Shortly after, the next most visited social media site accumulating 16% of users - also known as Twitter - made its debut in 2006. While Twitter has similar tools as Facebook, it is contrastingly different as Facebook emphasizes interacting with the community and friends, whereas Twitter encourages “tweeting” or posting random thoughts, mostly for oneself. At 14% of users, Instagram was ultimately the first social media platform of its kind, created in 2010. As a photo-sharing platform, users simply post any picture they want, with or without a caption. Users can see, like, or comment on other people’s photos. Over time, Instagram has added various features to keep up with other platforms, such as the ability to post videos or post to one’s own personal “story.” Pinterest is also different from most social media sites; created in 2008, and resulting in 13% of visitors, it has been a platform where users post pictures and tutorials for inspiration or to share ideas. Finally, and surprisingly, YouTube rings in last place at 2%. Established in 2005, YouTube is a site where users post videos, watch videos, comment, or subscribe to channels. It is no surprise that Facebook holds a large majority of visitors for social media; it was the first of its kind that has continued to be utilized by people of all ages - something that many other platforms have lacked</p>

                        <p>The bar graph on the left represents the top five most visited websites in the United States as of 2022, by billions. The five websites consist of Google, YouTube, Pornhb, and Facebook. According to the data, and as most would expect, Google is the most frequently visited website in the US, with a steady 17.11B. Created in 1998, Google is a search engine that anybody can use to look up information. Today, Google is being used every second - from quick questions to complex ones. Following Google, YouTube accumulates approximately 11.5B visitors. YouTube has a variety of purposes as it is free to post any videos or content, which often include music videos, tutorials, and quite literally anything else. Facebook follows YouTube with 2.34B visitors. While Facebook is a frequently visited website, it’s important to note that it is also the most widely used social media platform. The adult entertainment platform known as Pornhub, accumulates about 2.14B visitors. Launched in 2007, Pornhub has been the world’s leading free pornography website. Finally, Reddit marks its place as last of the top five with 2.07B visitors. Reddit is a forum and social news website that consists of countless communities. Created in 2005, it has consistently been a platform of discussion within communities and content ratings. While it comes as no surprise that Google has a vast amount of visitors compared to the other four websites, it is interesting to observe the other sites, such as Pornhub or Reddit, and analyze what their popularity means in terms of our society and how it reflects our use of technology.</p>

                        <p>The pie chart shown on the right demonstrates the most popular browsers in the United States. The five browsers include Chrome, Safari, Edge, FireFox, and Samsung Internet. To no surprise, Chrome is the leading most-popular browser. Chrome is a free, online browser that is owned and controlled by Google. Chrome was released in 2008 and has since risen to the top to become the most used web browser by accumulating 48% of internet users. Not far behind Chrome is the web browser Safari. Safari is owned and operated by Apple, which was launched in 2003 for computers and has since been the default browser for all Apple products including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and iMacs. As Apple products have become incredibly popular amongst the public, the preinstalled Safari browser has gained approximately 43% of all internet users. As Chrome and Safari take up a vast majority of internet users, there’s only so much room left for other browsers. Ranking #3 among the most popular browsers is Edge. Edge is owned and operated by Microsoft, and is the default browser for all Windows 10 devices and products. Accumulating an estimated 6% of internet users, Edge represents an interesting trend because although it has a small minority of users, the amount of people who use Microsoft devices is much higher. Following Edge, with an even smaller percentage of internet users at only 2%, FireFox is ranked as #4 among the most popular browsers. FireFox was released in 2002 and is owned and operated by the Mozilla Foundation. Similar to other web browsers, it’s free to use by the public, but it has been drastically declining in popularity since the release of Google Chrome. Finally, coming in last for the top five most visited browsers in the United States, is Samsung Internet. This browser is utilized by approximately 1% of internet users in the US and was released in 2012. Samsung Internet is the default web browser for Samsung Galaxy devices, which includes an array of devices such as smart TVs or Galaxy smartphones. </p>
