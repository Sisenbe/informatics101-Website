                        <p>The pie chart to the right demonstrates the most visited social media websites in the United States as of 2023; it includes Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Youtube. It’s quite clear that Facebook holds a majority of visitors at 55%, which should be expected. Facebook is the oldest platform of these five sites as it was created in 2004. While Facebook was not the first social networking platform to be created, its advanced components, community features, and  user-friendliness quickly pushed it to the forefront of social media. Shortly after, the next most visited social media site accumulating 16% of users - also known as Twitter - made its debut in 2006. While Twitter has similar tools as Facebook, it is contrastingly different as Facebook emphasizes interacting with the community and friends, whereas Twitter encourages “tweeting” or posting random thoughts, mostly for oneself. At 14% of users, Instagram was ultimately the first social media platform of its kind, created in 2010. As a photo-sharing platform, users simply post any picture they want, with or without a caption. Users can see, like, or comment on other people’s photos. Over time, Instagram has added various features to keep up with other platforms, such as the ability to post videos or post to one’s own personal “story.” Pinterest is also different from most social media sites; created in 2008, and resulting in 13% of visitors, it has been a platform where users post pictures and tutorials for inspiration or to share ideas. Finally, and surprisingly, YouTube rings in last place at 2%. Established in 2005, YouTube is a site where users post videos, watch videos, comment, or subscribe to channels. It is no surprise that Facebook holds a large majority of visitors for social media; it was the first of its kind that has continued to be utilized by people of all ages - something that many other platforms have lacked</p>

                        <p>The bar graph on the left represents the top five most visited websites in the United States as of 2022, by billions. The five websites consist of Google, YouTube, Pornhb, and Facebook. According to the data, and as most would expect, Google is the most frequently visited website in the US, with a steady 17.11B. Created in 1998, Google is a search engine that anybody can use to look up information. Today, Google is being used every second - from quick questions to complex ones. Following Google, YouTube accumulates approximately 11.5B visitors. YouTube has a variety of purposes as it is free to post any videos or content, which often include music videos, tutorials, and quite literally anything else. Facebook follows YouTube with 2.34B visitors. While Facebook is a frequently visited website, it’s important to note that it is also the most widely used social media platform. The adult entertainment platform known as Pornhub, accumulates about 2.14B visitors. Launched in 2007, Pornhub has been the world’s leading free pornography website. Finally, Reddit marks its place as last of the top five with 2.07B visitors. Reddit is a forum and social news website that consists of countless communities. Created in 2005, it has consistently been a platform of discussion within communities and content ratings. While it comes as no surprise that Google has a vast amount of visitors compared to the other four websites, it is interesting to observe the other sites, such as Pornhub or Reddit, and analyze what their popularity means in terms of our society and how it reflects our use of technology.</p>
